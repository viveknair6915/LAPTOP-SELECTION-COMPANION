<h1>LAPTOP SELECTION COMPANION by "VIVEK NAIR"</h1>
<h2>LAPTOP SELECTER</h2><br>
This application will help the user to choose the best laptop suitable for his requirements without worrying about the technical details. It will save users time and energy as they will not need to go through multiple websites to compare various configurations of laptops. The user will require almost no knowledge about different parts of a laptop and this will save him/her from overspending on a computer that the user does not need.<br>

<h2>FEATURES:</h2>
<li>First, the program asks the user some basic set of questions like about the budget, userâ€™s use cases, etc </li>
<li>Based on initial answers the major filtering occurs in the laptops from gaming, business, general use, etc, and the 30000 - 40000 or 50000-60000 range, etc. </li>
<li>Each set (gaming, business, general use, etc) consists of multiple laptop models. Further rounds filtering occurs based on the need of the user into apt spec conversion (by program) or user inputted specs.</li>
<li>After each round of filtering list of laptops is displayed along with information related to why the user needs that particular spec or how the spec will help the user.</li>
<li>At last, only a handful of laptops are displayed. The final decision can be taken by the user based on company bias or the price point or just randomly (because all of these options will be almost equivalent in performance etc to each other)</li><br>
